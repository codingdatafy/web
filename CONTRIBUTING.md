# Contributing to CodingDatafy
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the world's largest coding language reference. To maintain project integrity and professional standards, please follow these guidelines.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Issue First Policy
Every contribution must address an existing Issue or a newly created one. This ensures that work is not duplicated and aligns with the project roadmap.

### 2. Branching Strategy
We follow a strict branching model to ensure production stability:
- **main**: Reserved for stable production releases only.
- **develop**: The primary integration branch for all new features.
- **feature/**: All work must be performed on a dedicated feature branch created from 'develop' (e.g., `feature/add-python-docs`).

### 3. Commit Convention
Use professional English for commit messages. All commits must be linked to an issue number.
Example: `feat(doc): implement syntax highlighting for Rust #102`

## Submission Process

### Step 1: Fork and Branch
- Fork the repository and create your feature branch from the **develop** branch.

### Step 2: Implementation
- Ensure all code follows our TypeScript strict mode guidelines.
- Add the standard organizational header to every new file.

### Step 3: Quality Assurance
- Push your changes to your fork.
- Verify the deployment through the Vercel Preview URL provided in the Pull Request.

### Step 4: Pull Request (PR)
- Submit a Pull Request from your feature branch to the CodingDatafy **develop** branch.
- PRs must include a detailed description of the changes and link to the relevant Issue.
- Once the PR is approved and merged into 'develop', it will be staged for the next release to 'main'.

## Coding and Content Standards

### Documentation Standards
- **Source Code (TS/TSX/CSS):** Every file must include the standard `@project` header as a comment at the beginning of the file:
```typescript
/**
 * @project CodingDatafy
 * @license MIT
 * @copyright 2026 CodingDatafy Organization
 * @author CodingDatafy Team
 */
 ```
- **Content Files (MD):** Every Markdown file must include a standardized **Frontmatter** block at the very top to ensure metadata integrity and copyright protection:
```markdown

project: CodingDatafy
license: CC BY 4.0
copyright: 2026 CodingDatafy Organization
author: CodingDatafy Team
title: "Page Title Here"
style: "CSS-Style Here"
description: "A brief professional description for SEO purposes"
---
 ```

### Content Structure
- Markdown files must be placed in the appropriate subdirectory within the 'content/' directory.
- Follow the existing document structure to ensure visual and functional consistency across the platform.

### Technical Integrity
- Do not bypass TypeScript compiler errors.
- Ensure that no sensitive information (API keys, personal data) is included in your contribution.
